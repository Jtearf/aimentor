## 🧠 AI Persona System

### 🔍 Persona Research
Each persona is crafted using:
- Language style and tone
- Known beliefs and philosophies
- Famous quotes
- Decision-making frameworks
- Industry expertise areas
- Recent business ventures and interests
- Do's and Don'ts (e.g., Elon shouldn't comment on Taylor Swift)

### 🧾 Persona Prompt Examples

#### Elon Musk
```text
You are Elon Musk. Speak boldly, confidently, and with a touch of sarcasm. Focus on technology, space, and innovation. Use first principles thinking. Reference Tesla, SpaceX, X, and Neuralink. Use real Elon quotes like "I think it is possible for ordinary people to choose to be extraordinary." Do not fabricate companies or relationships. Avoid small talk. Stay in character.
```

#### Oprah Winfrey
```text
You are Oprah Winfrey. Speak warmly and empathetically, with wisdom and thoughtfulness. Focus on personal development, media, philanthropy, and entrepreneurship. Reference your media empire, book club, and your philosophy of living your best life. Use authentic Oprah phrases like "When you know better, you do better." Avoid fabricating events or relationships. Maintain your inspirational tone and stay in character.
```

#### Jeff Bezos
```text
You are Jeff Bezos. Speak methodically, strategically, and with customer-obsessed focus. Emphasize long-term thinking, innovation, and operational excellence. Reference Amazon's leadership principles, AWS, Blue Origin, and your philosophy of "Day 1" thinking. Use authentic Jeff quotes like "Your margin is my opportunity." Don't fabricate business deals or relationships. Stay analytical, pragmatic, and in character.
```

* Adjust `temperature: 0.7`, `frequency_penalty: 0.3` for all personas
* Use `presence_penalty: 0.2` to prevent repetitive responses
* Store prompt templates per persona in backend
* Implement context-aware responses (persona recalls previous parts of conversation)

## 📡 API Flow

### Chat Flow

**POST /api/chat**

```json
{
  "userId": "abc123",
  "persona": "elon",
  "message": "How do I get funding for my startup?",
  "conversationId": "xyz789"
}
```

**Server Logic**

```ts
1. Fetch persona prompt (e.g., Elon)
2. Load last 10 messages from user history
3. Format OpenAI API call:
   - System prompt + user/assistant messages
   - Include conversation context
4. Call OpenAI GPT-4o
5. Save reply to DB
6. Return streamed response to frontend
```

### Subscription Flow

**POST /api/subscribe**

```json
{
  "userId": "abc123",
  "plan": "monthly",
  "paymentMethod": "card",
  "amount": 999
}
```

```ts
1. Create PayStack payment session
2. Return checkout URL
3. On webhook success:
   - Update user.plan
   - Set credits_left to plan value
   - Create subscription record
   - Send confirmation email
```

## 💬 Chat UX Realism

### 🔁 Natural Turn-Taking

```js
// Display typing indicator with variable timing
const simulateTyping = async (message) => {
  // Start typing indicator
  setIsTyping(true);
  
  // Calculate dynamic wait time based on message length
  const thinkingTime = Math.min(700, 300 + message.length * 0.5);
  const typingTime = Math.min(3000, 1000 + message.length * 25);
  
  // Simulate thinking time
  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, thinkingTime));
  
  // Add preamble for longer responses
  if (message.length > 100) {
    setPreamble(getRandomPreamble());
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 700));
  }
  
  // Simulate typing time
  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, typingTime));
  
  // Stop typing indicator
  setIsTyping(false);
  
  // Display full message
  displayResponse(message);
  
  // Optional: Add haptic feedback on mobile
  if (isMobileDevice && navigator.vibrate) {
    navigator.vibrate(50);
  }
};
```

* "Elon is typing..." status with realistic timing
* Variable response times based on message length
* Optional preambles like "Let me think..." or "Interesting question…"
* Word-by-word or character-by-character typing animation option

#### Mobile Chat UI
* Bubble chat UI (left/right) with appropriately sized bubbles
* Avatar for persona (e.g., Elon image) as circle at top of screen
* Sticky header with persona name and status
* Bottom-fixed input bar with send button and attachment options
* Swipe gestures for additional actions (reply, bookmark)
* Pull-down to refresh conversation history
* Haptic feedback on new message arrival

#### Desktop Chat UI
* Two-column layout with persona selection sidebar
* Larger chat window with more visible history
* Hover states for interactive elements
* Keyboard shortcuts for power users
